Author:Anwesha Sahu

# Tasks completed at current stage:

1. Demo parton shower model implemented. 
   1. z has singularity at z = 0, PDF modified to PDF(z) = 1/z
        - Hence, lower bound of z calculated to be approximately 0.36788, using normalisation of PDF.
      
    2.  theta is colinear and has singularity at theta = 0. Hence, PDF(theta) modified to PDF(theta) = 1/theta
        - Hence, lower bound of theta calculated as approximately 0.5779 radians, using normalisation of PDF
        
2. Tree diagram created for each set of multiple splittings to create parton shower

3. Several multiple-splitting event sets generated 

4. Analysis conducted for number of accepted versus rejected events as per conditions described in 1.a.

5. Visual summary of total accepted versus rejected events generated

# Tasks due:

1. Hadronisation
